# Project Overview
Since 2021, a new store chain in the Portland Metro Area(Oregon) has been expanding its footprint, aiming to capture a significant share of the local retail market. As part of this growth strategy, the Regional Manager tasked me with analyzing sales data to uncover key insights that could drive profitability, optimize inventory management, and improve customer retention.

To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I partnered with another data analyst and collaborated with regional store managers, inventory specialists, and marketing partners to align our findings with business objectives. Our primary focus was to evaluate sales performance across different locations, identify top-performing products, assess return rates, and determine trends in customer purchasing behavior.

This report presents data-driven insights that will help to improve overall sales efficiency. By leveraging sales trends and customer data, we aim to provide actionable recommendations that support the company’s continued success in the competitive Portland retail market.

# Executive Summary
An analysis of 10,000 transactions from 2021 to 2024 reveals that the company generated a total revenue of $3.3 million. However, revenue has been declining at an average rate of 3.5% per year, with 2022 being the worst-performing year—potentially due to COVID-related impacts, which warrant further investigation. Among the company’s locations, the Gresham store leads in revenue, contributing 25.6% of total sales. In terms of product categories, Electronics dominate, accounting for 76.1% of total revenue.

Meanwhile, repeat purchase rates have stabilized around 63%, indicating steady customer retention. The company should invest more into the marketing and promotion of their electronics while allocating funds from underperforming products to zone in on their best sellers. The company can also implement bundling deals and LTOs to add more emphasis and attention to otherwise overlooked items.

# Insights
## Sales Performance & Trends

- The company experienced its highest sales in October 2024, reaching $76.3K in revenue. This could be attributed to the start of the major holiday season, but a comparison of October figures over the past four years would help confirm this pattern.

- In August 2022, the company recorded its lowest revenue of $57.8K. However, earnings rebounded by nearly 26% the following month, before experiencing a decline over the next five months, with a recovery beginning in April 2023.

- 2021 was the strongest year for revenue ($888.9K, representing 27% of total revenue), average order value ($347.37), and order volume (2,559 orders). After the first year of operations, sales fell by 12.3% over the next two years, before increasing by 1.8% in 2024.

- There is clear seasonality in sales, with spring and summer holidays and promotional months making up 51% of the total revenue.

- Sales are significantly higher on weekdays, contributing $2.4M, or 73% of total revenue.


## Customer Behavior & Loyalty

- Out of 500 unique customers, 316 are repeat buyers, contributing $2.1M in revenue, which accounts for 64.4% of total sales.

- Female customers primarily favored T-Shirts and Baseball Bats, while male customers preferred Curtains. Customers identifying as "other" were most drawn to Perfume.

- The 40-49 age group generated the highest revenue at $693.4K, closely followed by the 20-29 age group at $673.9K. Both the 30-39 and 40-49 age groups were the most profitable, each achieving a 78.5% profit margin.

- The Gold tier membership is the most popular, with 129 customers enrolled, and it attracts the highest number of new sign-ups. However, the Silver tier has generated the most revenue, totaling $861.3K. Despite being the highest-priced, Platinum tier members have contributed the least in terms of overall spending. It may be worth considering the removal of the Platinum tier to focus on Bronze, Silver, and Gold memberships.

- Repeat purchases (>= 2 purchases) have hovered around 63%, suggesting that the company has a strong loyal core of customers who consistenly make multiple purchases each year.
