# Project Overview
Since 2021, a new store chain in the Portland Metro Area(Oregon) has been expanding its footprint, aiming to capture a significant share of the local retail market. As part of this growth strategy, the Regional Manager tasked me with analyzing sales data to uncover key insights that could drive profitability, optimize inventory management, and improve customer retention.

To ensure a comprehensive analysis, I partnered with another data analyst and collaborated with regional store managers, inventory specialists, and marketing partners to align our findings with business objectives. Our primary focus was to evaluate sales performance across different locations, identify top-performing products, assess return rates, and determine trends in customer purchasing behavior.

This report presents data-driven insights that will help to improve overall sales efficiency. By leveraging sales trends and customer data, we aim to provide actionable recommendations that support the company’s continued success in the competitive Portland retail market.

# Executive Summary
An analysis of 10,000 transactions from 2021 to 2024 reveals that the company generated a total revenue of $3.3 million. However, revenue has been declining at an average rate of 3.5% per year, with 2022 being the worst-performing year—potentially due to COVID-related impacts, which warrant further investigation. Among the company’s locations, the Gresham store leads in revenue, contributing 25.6% of total sales. In terms of product categories, Electronics dominate, accounting for 76.1% of total revenue.

Meanwhile, repeat purchase rates have stabilized around 63%, indicating steady customer retention. The company should invest more into the marketing and promotion of their electronics while allocating funds from underperforming products to zone in on their best sellers. The company can also implement bundling deals and LTOs to add more emphasis and attention to otherwise overlooked items.
